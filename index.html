<p>Hello! Nice to meet you, I'm Ismael Ebrada, currently studying in Asia Pacific College. Im 19 years old and only son in my family.
I graduated junior high in Don Bosco Technical college and my Senior high here in Asia Pacific College. Growing up as a kid,
I dreamt of being an Engineer that's why my parents chose Don bosco during my junior high year, when I was about to enter college 
my dreams of being an Engineer became gray, so I chose IT and planned to stay here in APC. As a student of APC since SHS i can say
that APC can really mold you and help you to excel in your academics. During my senior high year in APC, i wasn't sure enough on
what course should i choose in college, but thanks to this school because they were able to help me find my passion and that's about
computer, so I chose IT as my course here. 

<p>Growing up as the only son in my family, I tend to spend my summer vacation with my family and friends.
Last month, we were in Batangas to spend our vacation together with my family. During summer, I tend to play basketball a lot
with my friends, and play video games with them when we're bored. I also workout during summer because I really want to become
active during these days and I dont want to get fat that's why im trying my best to become healthy.

<p>Lastly, I expect to learn the basic fundamentals of User Design and Programming. I also expect that our professor will guide and help us through out the semester.
